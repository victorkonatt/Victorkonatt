                        Neuroplasticity principles help us understand that anyone can learn anything. Before neuroplasticity
                        study researchers believed that brains stops growing after certain age which kind of stops people
                        from
                        learning new things. Our brain is like plastic that is why it’s called neuroplasticity. Every time
                        we
                        think or do a new task a new road map is created in the brain. And the more time we repeat the new
                        task
                        stronger the connection between the roads. Hence the principles give people a hope that they can
                        never
                        give up.

                      Sometimes when doing the course I have been facing a lot of times where I think I don’t know if I can do
                      the exercises or not but understanding the principals and be positive not only doing this course but
                      learning anything in future.

                    I will be practicing tasks everyday so that neurons are can get stronger in different ability that I
                    am
                    trying to learn and also by giving time to rest to brain.
