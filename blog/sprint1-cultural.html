            Perseverance – I would like to add this as my first value because hard work is important for me.
                    This value helps to face obstacles in difficult times by not giving up.</br>

                    Patience – When things get uncomfortable patience teaches me to have self-control.</br>

                    Generosity – my friends and family say that I am generous. It gives me happiness when anyone issue
                    or problem is solved. I like to help even if I don’t have the knowledge or skills sometimes but
                    maybe by just being there for someone.</br>

                    When I was working as computer technician I had a customer who was around 80 years old. And she was
                    sad because she had lost all her data on her phone which was liquid damaged. I took a decision to
                    help her after work hours and not to charge her for it. So I arranged a time to meet her and resolve
                    this issue for her. I visited her place. I was hoping her data would be on the cloud but the real
                    difficulty was her icloud id and password was so we spent hours going through to find password.
                    Finally we found apple ID and password on her diary. We logged on a computer and all her important
                    data was there and I copied this to her new phone. I was working for a company that time so I had to
                    do this work after work hours and spend around 3 hours getting this done for this lady. I did not
                    charge her any money. I think I did this just of generosity.</br>

            My strengths are perseverance and patience as I don’t like to give up and try with all my patience.</br>

            Limitations would be I am slow learner.</br>

            Both of my strength might help me in my learning Journey and might intersect with learning
            obstacles.</br>
            
            There was a time when I was working in a project of lot of people. The software was poorly created
                    because it did not record who edited/ added or deleted information and sometimes no one would own up
                    and it caused tension in the team. I used a word document at that time to keep notes of any changes
                    I made in that project. I would try Github service now because it records every detail efficiently.</br>
