                    <ul> Difference between HTML and CSS
                        HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
                        <li> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</li>
                        <li> HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup</li>
                        <li> HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages</li>
                        <li> HTML elements are represented by tags</li>
                        <li> HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on</li>
                        <li> Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul> CSS
                        <li> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
                        <li> CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
                        </li>>
                        <li> CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
                        <li> External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>
                    </ul> </br>

                    Control Flow is the order in which computer statements in a script. For example in daily life if the
                    fridge is empty it’s time to get some grocery this is one kind of if statement. Another example
                    would be while water gets boiled in the kettle make an omlette.


                    DOM is a document object model where different language can be read by representing a part of the
                    document.





                    Arrays are generally used to store same kind of collection of things and arrays uses [] brackets.
                    You can access elements by example[0]. Array counting starts from 0
                    In object is a collection of different things and uses {} brackets. You can access object values by
                    (.) notation
                    What is function and why are they useful?
                    A function can perform task for you. It is also termed as “building blocks” They allow the code to
                    be called many times without repetition.
