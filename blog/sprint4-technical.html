                    I was trying to find a setup file to run for software but I could not find where the file was so I
                    spent hours finding a way on how to install the software. I looked up on Google and also looked for
                    a readme file in the folder to see instructions but there was nothing anywhere. I was frustrated and
                    then I checked with the support team and realized that all I had to do was copy and paste and there
                    was no need to install it on the computer.

                        Once my friend’s phone text format changed to a random unclear format and it was difficult to
                        read. I luckily had a similar phone so I went to settings on my phone and found out where I
                        could reset text settings. I used the same pattern to follow on my friend’s phone and reset the
                        text settings. It worked and the text was easy to read.

                            Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:
                        <li> Pseudocode - I feel Pseudocode works good for me because I can write easy steps</li>
                        <li> Trying something – its only 10% chance that worked for me during sprint 4 </li>
                        <li>Rubber ducky method – Tried to use this but was not going anywhere </li>
                        <li>Reading error messages – Works really well for me </li>
                        <li>Console.logging – Works almost similar as error messages for me </li>
                        <li>Googling – Google will help me find most answers online </li>
                        <li>Asking your peers for help – Yes but I should be doing this more </li>
                        <li>Asking coaches for help – Yes I have been getting a lot of help from my facilitator </li>
                        <li>Improving your process with reflection – Yes it help me revise the excerise </li>
