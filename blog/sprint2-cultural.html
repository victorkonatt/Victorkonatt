            I would like to become a web developer and also start a career in building apps for hand held devices in
                future. In EDA I would like to develop myself where I can contribute and communicate efficiently in the
                team. I would also like to get better at problem solving skills.My strength would be determination and
                hardworking and my weakness would be planning for e.g. If I have multiple tasks I might just spend lot
                of time on the first one to do it properly and then realize that I don’t have time left for other task.
                In order to work be able to overcome my weakness I will plan my work. Also creating a map will help me
                plan my work efficiently. While studying if I have any questions or advice I will reach out to my
                facilitator or cohort via slack. Guidance or help through this journey is something I am looking for
                which I have already received and happy about it  I don’t have any commitment at the moment so will be
                available during the work hours or weekends as well.
